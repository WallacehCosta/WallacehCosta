# Hello! I’m Wallace Costa 👋

## Backend Developer

I’m a backend-focused developer working with Python to build reliable, well-structured server-side systems.

I design RESTful APIs, handle authentication and authorization, model databases, and implement business rules with a strong focus on clean architecture and maintainability.

My goal is to build scalable, secure backend systems aligned with real business needs, while continuously improving my understanding of system design and production-grade practices.
