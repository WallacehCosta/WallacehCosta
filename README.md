# Hello! I’m Wallace Costa 👋

## Backend Developer

I’m a backend-focused developer with experience building reliable, well-structured server-side systems using Python.

My work is centered on designing RESTful APIs, implementing authentication and authorization flows, modeling databases, and enforcing business rules in a clear and maintainable way. I prioritize clean architecture, separation of concerns, and code that can evolve safely over time.

I’m particularly interested in building backend systems that are scalable, secure, and aligned with real business needs, rather than one-off or purely academic solutions.

I’m continuously improving my understanding of backend architecture, system design, and best practices used in real-world production environments.
